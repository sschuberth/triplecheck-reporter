        + "\n"
        + "When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. O"

        + "that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change t"
        + "he software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed"
        + " that you can do these things.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to"
        + " deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictio"
        + "ns translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the"
        + " library or if you modify it.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fe"
        + "e, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make s"
        + "ure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code w"

        + "\n"
        + "We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and"
        + " (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distri"

        + "\n"
        + "To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warr"

        + " to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary Gener"
        + "al Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit "
        + "linking those libraries into non-free programs.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared li"

        + "ive of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permi"
        + "ts such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The"
        + " Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code "
        + "with the library.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to"

        + "ovides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-fr"
        + "ee programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Publ"
        + "ic License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages i"
        + "n certain special circumstances.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the wid"
        + "est possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. T"
        + "o achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more fre"
        + "quent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libr"
        + "aries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to fre"
        + "e software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enab"
        + "les a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example"
        + ", permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more peo"
        + "ple to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux"
        + " operating system.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' free"
        + "dom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library h"
        + "as the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version "
        + "of the Library.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification foll"
        + "ow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" "
        + "and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the li"
        + "brary, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n"
        + "\n"
        + "0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which"
        + " contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party sayi"
        + "ng it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License ("
        + "also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n"
        + "\n"
        + "A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as "
        + "to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those fun"
        + "ctions and data) to form executables.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been"
        + " distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the L"
        + "ibrary or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work contai"
        + "ning the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/o"
        + "r translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation "
        + "is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n"
        + "\n"
        + "\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modific"
        + "ations to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for "
        + "all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus th"
        + "e scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by "
        + "this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the"
        + " Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if it"
        + "s contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the"
        + " Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Lib"
        + "rary does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source "
        + "code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appro"
        + "priately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of "
        + "warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the abse"
        + "nce of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Librar"
        + "y.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at"
        + " your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus "
        + "forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications "
        + "or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of t"
        + "hese conditions:\n"
        + "\n"
        + "a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n"
        + "b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you"
        + " changed the files and the date of any change.\n"
        + "c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third"
        + " parties under the terms of this License.\n"
        + "d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data"
        + " to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as "
        + "an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith"
        + " effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such functio"
        + "n or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpo"
        + "se remains meaningful.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that"
        + " is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection "
        + "2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this functio"
        + "n must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root funct"
        + "ion must still compute square roots.)\n"
        + "\n"
        + "These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sectio"
        + "ns of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably consider"
        + "ed independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its term"
        + "s, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. Bu"
        + "t when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based"
        + " on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this Lice"
        + "nse, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus "
        + "to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your right"
        + "s to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right t"
        + "o control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Librar"
        + "y.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the "
        + "Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distri"
        + "bution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License ins"
        + "tead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter "
        + "all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary G"
        + "NU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer ve"
        + "rsion than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, th"
        + "en you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other chan"
        + "ge in these notices.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so t"
        + "he ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and deri"
        + "vative works made from that copy.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into"
        + " a program that is not a library.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, un"
        + "der Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 a"
        + "nd 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machin"
        + "e-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 "
        + "and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designa"
        + "ted place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same"
        + " place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though thir"
        + "d parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is d"
        + "esigned to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called "
        + "a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative w"
        + "ork of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an exec"
        + "utable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the "
        + "Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefor"
        + "e covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such execu"
        + "tables.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is par"
        + "t of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the L"
        + "ibrary even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially si"
        + "gnificant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itsel"
        + "f a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts an"
        + "d accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in l"
        + "ength), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether i"
        + "t is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus po"
        + "rtions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n"
        + "\n"
        + "Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the ob"
        + "ject code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing "
        + "that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly wit"
        + "h the Library itself.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work t"
        + "hat uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of "
        + "the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that "
        + "the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse"
        + " engineering for debugging such modifications.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is us"
        + "ed in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must "
        + "supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright n"
        + "otices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as wel"
        + "l as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must "
        + "do one of these things:\n"
        + "\n"
        + "a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source co"
        + "de for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must "
        + "be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable "
        + "linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the "
        + "Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Lib"
        + "rary and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Li"
        + "brary. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions f"
        + "iles in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to"
        + " use the modified definitions.)\n"
        + "b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suita"
        + "ble mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already pre"
        + "sent on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into t"
        + "he executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the libr"
        + "ary, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-comp"
        + "atible with the version that the work was made with.\n"
        + "c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to g"
        + "ive the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge "
        + "no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\n"
        + "d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designa"
        + "ted place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from th"
        + "e same place.\n"
        + "e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that y"
        + "ou have already sent this user a copy.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must in"
        + "clude any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from i"
        + "t. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not inc"
        + "lude anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) wit"
        + "h the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on "
        + "which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executab"

        + "\n"
        + "It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of othe"
        + "r proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Suc"
        + "h a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an "
        + "executable that you distribute.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by"
        + "-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by "
        + "this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate"
        + " distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library faciliti"
