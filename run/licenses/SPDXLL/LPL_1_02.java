        + "ement:\n"
        + "i.  effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and con"
        + "ditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and no"
        + "n-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitn"
        + "ess for a particular purpose;\n"

        + "cludes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Distributor (\"Commerci"
        + "al Distributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every Contributor (\"Indem"
        + "nified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses"

        + "pply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual prop"
        + "erty infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) prom"
        + "ptly notify the Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow th"
        + "e Commercial Distributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Distribut"
        + "or in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Cont"
        + "ributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "For example, a Distributor might include the Program in a commercial product off"

        + "to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Distri"
        + "butor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Distributor wou"
        + "ld have to defend claims against the Contributors related to those performance c"
        + "laims and warranties, and if a court requires any Contributor to pay any damages"
        + " as a result, the Commercial Distributor must pay those damages.\n"
