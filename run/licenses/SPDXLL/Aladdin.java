        + "y change. In each source file that you have modified, you must include a promine"

        + "(ii) You must cause the Work to be licensed as a whole and at no charge to all"
        + " third parties under the terms of this License;\n"
        + "(iii) If the Work normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cau"

        + "rnel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, you must "
        + "also distribute the source code of that component if you have it and are allowed"
        + " to do so;\n"
        + "(v) If you distribute any written or printed material at all with the Work, su"
        + "ch material must include either a written copy of this License, or a prominent w"
        + "ritten indication that the Work is covered by this License and written instructi"
        + "ons for printing and/or displaying the copy of the License on the distribution m"

        + "f the rights granted herein.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering the equivalent "
        + "ability to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent ability to cop"
