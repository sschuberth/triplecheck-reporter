        + "maintaining this same freedom for others. Many databases are covered by\n"
        + "copyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some\n"
        + "jurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that\n"
        + "cover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally,\n"
        + "the ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to\n"
