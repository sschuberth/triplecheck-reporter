        + "ent a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Paten"
        + "ts to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribu"
        + "tion of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This pate"

        + " Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The"

        + "ribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n"
        + "c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to i"

        + " that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property ri"
        + "ghts of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient "
        + "for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual pro"

        + "granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure a"
        + "ny other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third pa"
        + "rty patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it "
        + "is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Pr"
        + "ogram.\n"
        + "d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright"
        + " rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in"

        + "\n"
        + "a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n"
        + "b) its license agreement:\n"
        + "i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and condi"
        + "tions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-"
        + "infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitnes"
        + "s for a particular purpose;\n"
        + "ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damage"
        + "s, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, su"
        + "ch as lost profits;\n"
        + "iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by"
        + " that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n"
        + "iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,"

        + "\n"

        + "the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does"
        + " not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contribu"
        + "tor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Co"
        + "mmercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contrib"
        + "utor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collecti"
        + "vely \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by "
        + "a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the ac"
        + "ts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distributi"
        + "on of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this sect"
        + "ion do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intel"
        + "lectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor m"
        + "ust: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and"
        + " b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commerci"
        + "al Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Inde"
        + "mnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product off"
        + "ering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Com"
        + "mercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related "
        + "to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contri"
        + "butor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor wou"
        + "ld have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those perform"
        + "ance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay"
        + " any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n"
