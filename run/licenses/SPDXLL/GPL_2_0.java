        + "titute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running t"
        + "he Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as y"
        + "ou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately "
        + "publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;"

        + "or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of t"

        + "\n"
        + "  a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that y"

        + "d as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n"

        + " warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, a"
        + "nd telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Progr"

        + "ed independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its term"
        + "s, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. Bu"

        + " its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept "
        + "this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work b"

        + "der this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you "
        + "may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would no"
        + "t permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive cop"
        + "ies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both"
        + " it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Progr"
        + "am.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any partic"
        + "ular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the secti"
        + "on as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n"
