        + "titute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running t"
        + "he Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as y"
        + "ou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately "
        + "publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;"
        + " keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of an"

        + "forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications "
        + "or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of t"
        + "hese conditions:\n"
        + "\n"
        + "  a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that y"

        + "  b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in"
        + " part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be license"
        + "d as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n"

        + " must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordina"
        + "ry way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright n"
        + "otice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a"
        + " warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, a"
        + "nd telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Progr"
        + "am itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your "
        + "work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n"
        + "\n"
        + "These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sectio"
        + "ns of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably consider"
        + "ed independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its term"
        + "s, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. Bu"
        + "t when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based"

        + "to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your right"

        + "provided that you also do one of the following:\n"

        + "which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium "

        + "  b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give "
        + "any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing so"

        + "from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code"
        + " from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though thir"
        + "d parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as exp"

        + " its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept "
        + "this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work b"

        + " distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may"

        + "on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the cond"
        + "itions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this Licen"

        + "der this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you "
        + "may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would no"
        + "t permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive cop"
        + "ies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both"
        + " it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Progr"
        + "am.\n"
        + "\n"
        + "If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any partic"
        + "ular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the secti"
        + "on as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n"
