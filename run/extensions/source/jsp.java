 * FileComment: <text> This class provides details about files that have
 * the extension of type jsp. Extensions tend to represent a specific type
 * of file structure from where we can extract information. In some cases, the
 * same type of file is used for representing different types of data from 
 * different types of applications. We make no specific arrangement to handle
 * these cases, albeit this class should be able of distinguishing each one of
 * them and then provide a suited answer. For example, NFO files are both used
 * as text files with information or used as binay files by a different tool.
 * 
 * The extension handler should be able of distinguishing these cases.
