reporter
========

This tool helps to evaluate your source code quality from a licensing compliance perspective.

The end result is a report written in SPDX format that includes:
- License and copyright identification (LGPL, GPL, Apache)
- Lines Of Code (LOC)
- Checksums (MD5, SHA256, TLSH)
- Filenames (and types)
- File size

The most common usages are:
- Estimate the code size (and complexity) before auditing the licenses
- See how well your code is identifiable to humans and licensing tools

License
==================

AGPL version 3.0 or (at your option) any later version.

You find the source code, installation documentation and
a bug tracker at https://github.com/triplecheck/reporter
