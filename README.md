========

This tool is useful for the cases when you want to evaluate your source code from a licensing compliance perspective.

The end result is a report written in SPDX format that includes the following details:
- Lines Of Code (LOC)
- Checksums (MD5, SHA256, SSDEEP)
- Filenames
- Basic license identification (LGPL, GPL, Apache)
- File size

With this kind of information becomes possible to get a preliminary idea of the code before access to the source is made available.
