 * FileComment: <text> A very strange but necessary class. This class was 
 * written to be used with a search box. I wanted to provide a good feature:
 * whenever the user types a key on the search box, the results start to appear
 * according to what was already typed. This works like modern search engines
 * do. However, the problem is that when the knowledge is quite extense then it
 * starts to take some time to retrieve results. 
 * 
 * Even worse is the fact that the user needs sometimes to type a long word and
 * this search method will drag to a big delay the whole search process, making
 * it less pleasant.
 * 
 * How can we reduce this kind of issue? The idea is that when the user is
 * typing several keys in a very short amount of time then we don't need to
 * perform a new search for all these keys, we can track the time between 
 * keystrokes and only perform a search when he waits for something like 
 * half a second. The user doesn't notice that this happens in the background 
 * and we don't need to perform searches that would otherwise be safe to
 * consider as redundant. Everyone gets happy! :-) </text>
