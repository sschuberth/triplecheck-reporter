- Back button has limited history (only one level, this needs to be improved)
- Dependency discovery should be included, list the imports that were found
- Free analysis (5 minute' video with upload service, email feedback)
- When clicking on "list files without license" and then "details" => gives error
---------------------

- Extensions needs to support cases like .hg_archival.txt
- missing a page where user learns how to automate the SPDX generation
- where applicable files mentioned with copyright?
- We need cache generation to speed up loading times
- Reduce size of extension classes (some methods are never used)
- Make triggers to be categorized (imports, copyrights, licenses, etc)
- Track files generated automatically (part of triggers?)
- Report should not be generated if it does not contain all files in package


x Missing to show the licenses that were found
x When viewing details about a file, show extension description
x add icons for images, documents, archives depending on file type
