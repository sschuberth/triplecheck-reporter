--- Critical ------
- Files without recognizable extensions are not being processed



--- Annoying ------
- In Linux, clicking "Create report" doesn't show last folder on first try
- Extensions are no longer automatically generated

--- Fix one day ---
- Back button has limited history (only one level, this needs to be improved)
- Dependency discovery should be included, list the imports that were found
- Extensions needs to support cases like .hg_archival.txt
- missing a page where user learns how to automate the SPDX generation
- Track files generated automatically (part of triggers?)
- Report should not be generated if it does not contain all files in package

--- Done ----------
x License detection needs test projects to use as example
x License detection needs to index at minimum the top 10 popular licenses
x Need to refresh popularity list after some dozens of files were processed
x We need cache generation to speed up loading times
x where applicable files mentioned with copyright?
x Reduce size of extension classes (some methods are never used)
x Make triggers to be categorized (imports, copyrights, licenses, etc)
x unknown extensions don't show extension finder
x .bpk,.res,  is not known
x .~pas needs a category for temp files
x .exe is unknown
x .cur (mouse cursor is not recognized)
x Missing to show the licenses that were found
x When viewing details about a file, show extension description
x add icons for images, documents, archives depending on file type
