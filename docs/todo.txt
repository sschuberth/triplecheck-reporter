- Back button has limited history (only one level, this needs to be improved)
- Dependency discovery should be included, list the imports that were found
- Free analysis (5 minute' video with upload service, email feedback)
- When clicking on "list files without license" and then "details" => gives error
---------------------

- Extensions needs to support cases like .hg_archival.txt
- missing a page where user learns how to automate the SPDX generation
- We need cache generation to speed up loading times
- Track files generated automatically (part of triggers?)
- Report should not be generated if it does not contain all files in package

Log
- Need to refresh popularity list after some dozens of files were processed
