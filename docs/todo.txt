- Back button has limited history (only one level, this needs to be improved)
- Simplify initial menu, only "CREATE REPORT" should be visible on top
- Dependency discovery should be included, list the imports that were found
- Free analysis (5 minute' video with upload service, email feedback)
- When clicking on "list files without license" and then "details" => gives error
