What do I need right now?

~- Saving an empty value is not working (for .e.g on the company name)

Limitations of BeanShell on the Java IDE

Not supported:

--- Arrays
This is not accepted:
  ArrayList<SPDXfile> list;
This is the alternative:
  ArrayList list;
And then:
  for(Object object : list){
     SPDXfile spdx = (SPDXfile) object;
  }

- Unlimited arrays are not supported:
myArray...

--- Strings
- There is no "isEmpty()" method like:
if(text.isEmpty()){}
This is the alternative
if(text.length()>0){}
